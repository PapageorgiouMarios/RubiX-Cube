## RubiX Cube
🟥⬜🟦 The Rubik's Cube is a 3D combination puzzle invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture

🟨🟩🟧 Ernő Rubik. In this project as shown in the video we are presented with a classic 3x3 cube which is in a randomized state.

It is a good opportunity for casual cube players to test their skills on a digital level :)

## How to Play 🕹

### **Toggle Between Modes (View/Action)**
- **K key**: Press to toggle between **View Mode** and **Action Mode**.
    - **View Mode**: You can inspect the cube without making any accidental rotations.
    - **Action Mode**: You can rotate the cube by clicking on its sides.

### **Mouse Clicks for Rotations**
While in **Action Mode**, you can rotate the cube by clicking on the sides.

- **Left Mouse Click**: 
    - Click on the left, right, front, or back face of the cube to rotate that specific side 90° in a clockwise direction.
    - This rotates the selected side clockwise, along with its adjacent pieces (like a real Rubik's Cube).
  
- **Right Mouse Click**: 
    - Click on the top or bottom face of the cube to rotate that side 90° clockwise.
    - This moves the top or bottom pieces in a similar manner to how you’d rotate those sides on a physical cube.
